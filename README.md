# CancerStageClassification
we report on the binary cancer staging classification from unstructured clinical notes and reports using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. This is significant because we can build a prospective predictive model and significantly cut down on the time of the retrospective manual annotation process to determine cancer stages.

I have also written scripts for statistical description of the number of sentences in different reports, how the keywords are distributed.
